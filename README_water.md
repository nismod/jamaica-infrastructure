What do we need to reproduce for the water sector?

Let's start at jamaica.infrastructureresilience.org and work backwards.

The viewer presents:

- Vector asset layers (all tabs)
    - Potable water supply
        - Pipelines (linestrings)
        - Supply facilities (points)
            - Booster station
            - Catchment
            - Entombment
            - ...
            - Treatment plant
    - Irrigation
        - Canals (linestrings)
        - Wells (points)
    - Wastewater
        - Pipelines (linestrings)
            - Gravity
            - Pressurised
        - Facilities (points)
            - Sump
            - Pump
            - Relift station
            - Treatment plant

- Damage and loss results for a variety of epochs and RCPs (Risk tab)
    - Direct damages (EAD) [J$/a]
        - River flooding
        - Surface flooding
        - Coastal flooding
    - Economic losses (EAEL) [J$/a]
        - River flooding
        - Surface flooding
        - Coastal flooding

- Drought (Adaptation tab) for three RCPs (no epoch)
    - Drought risk variables (vector polygons, similar to provinces, but not the same)
        - Mean monthly water stress (0.08 ~ 11.3), higher is less stress?
        - Expected population disrupted
        - Expected annual economic losses (EAEL) [J$/day]
    - Adaptation options (vector points, about 24 in total)
        Cost [J$]
        Population protected
        Benefit [J$]
        Benefit-cost ratio
